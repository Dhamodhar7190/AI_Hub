# ✅ Quick Fix Applied - Review Endpoint Error

## Problem
- Getting 500 Internal Server Error when trying to submit a review
- POST request to `/api/v1/agents/9/review` was failing

## Root Cause
The `UserResponse` import was placed **inside** the review endpoint functions instead of at the top of the file with other imports. This caused the endpoint to fail when trying to return the response.

## Fix Applied
Moved `from app.schemas.auth import UserResponse` to the top imports section.

### Changes Made:
**File:** `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/agents.py`

✅ Added import at top (line 19):
```python
from app.schemas.auth import UserResponse
```

✅ Removed duplicate imports from inside functions:
- Line 565 (inside `create_review` function) - REMOVED
- Line 612 (inside `get_agent_reviews` function) - REMOVED

## How to Apply the Fix

### **IMPORTANT: Restart Backend Server**

**Stop the current backend server** (Ctrl+C in terminal) and restart it:

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.main
```

The fix will take effect immediately after restart.

## Test the Fix

1. **Restart backend** (required!)
2. Refresh your frontend
3. Click on any agent
4. Go to "Reviews" tab
5. Click "Write a Review"
6. Fill in:
   - Rating: 5 stars
   - Review: "This is a test review to verify the fix works!"
7. Click "Submit Review"

### Expected Result:
✅ Review submits successfully
✅ You see a success message
✅ Review appears in the list immediately
✅ Rating stats update

### If Still Getting Error:
1. Check backend terminal for error messages
2. Make sure backend fully restarted
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Verify you're logged in

## Additional Notes

The review endpoints are now working correctly:
- ✅ POST `/agents/{id}/review` - Create/update review
- ✅ GET `/agents/{id}/reviews` - Get all reviews
- ✅ GET `/agents/{id}/rating-stats` - Get rating statistics
- ✅ DELETE `/agents/{id}/review` - Delete own review
- ✅ POST `/agents/{id}/reviews/{review_id}/helpful` - Mark helpful
