## 🎯 How It Works

### When User Opens Agent Modal:

1. **Modal opens** with 2 tabs visible
2. **"Details" tab** is active by default (shows iframe)
3. **Background:** Automatically fetches:
   - Rating statistics (average, count, distribution)
   - Recent reviews

### When User Clicks "Reviews" Tab:

1. **Displays rating overview:**
   - Large average rating number
   - Star visualization
   - Rating distribution chart (5★ to 1★)

2. **Shows "Write a Review" button**

3. **Displays all reviews:**
   - User avatar + name
   - Star rating
   - Review text
   - Helpful count
   - Date posted

### When User Submits Review:

1. **Form validation:**
   - Must select rating (1-5 stars)
   - Must write at least 10 characters

2. **API call** to create/update review

3. **On success:**
   - Hide review form
   - Refresh ratings & reviews
   - Show updated data

4. **Updates:**
   - Average rating recalculated
   - Rating distribution updated
   - New review appears in list

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Reviews not loading
**Check:**
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for API calls
- Backend is running
- Authentication token is valid

### Can't submit review
**Common issues:**
- Rating not selected (shows error)
- Review too short (< 10 chars)
- Agent not approved
- Already submitted review (should show "Update" instead)

### TypeScript errors
**If you see import errors:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Components not found
**Verify files exist:**
```bash
ls frontend/src/components/rating/
# Should show:
# RatingStars.tsx
# ReviewForm.tsx
# ReviewList.tsx
```
